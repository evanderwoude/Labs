\section*{Prior to Lab}

Before attending this lab:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Read and familiarize yourself with this handout.
  \item Review the following free textbook resources:
	\begin{itemize}
  	  \item \url{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/Strings }
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Peer Programming Pair-Up}

To encourage collaboration and a team environment, labs will be
structured in a \emph{pair programming} setup.  At the start of
each lab, you will be randomly paired up with another student 
(conflicts such as absences will be dealt with by the lab instructor).
One of you will be designated the \emph{driver} and the other
the \emph{navigator}.  

The navigator will be responsible for reading the instructions and
telling the driver what to do next.  The driver will be in charge of the
keyboard and workstation.  Both driver and navigator are responsible
for suggesting fixes and solutions together.  Neither the navigator
nor the driver is ``in charge.''  Beyond your immediate pairing, you
are encouraged to help and interact and with other pairs in the lab.

Each week you should alternate: if you were a driver last week, 
be a navigator next, etc.  Resolve any issues (you were both drivers
last week) within your pair.  Ask the lab instructor to resolve issues
only when you cannot come to a consensus.  

Because of the peer programming setup of labs, it is absolutely 
essential that you complete any pre-lab activities and familiarize
yourself with the handouts prior to coming to lab.  Failure to do
so will negatively impact your ability to collaborate and work with 
others which may mean that you will not be able to complete the
lab.  

\section{Lab Objectives \& Topics}
At the end of this lab you should be familiar with the following
\begin{itemize}
  \item Declare and print a string in C
  \item Manipulate strings in a variety of ways
  \item Use some basic functions from the \mintinline{text}{string.h} library
\end{itemize}

\section{Background}

Strings are collections of characters.  In C, Strings are represented using 
arrays of char values terminated by a special null-terminating character, 
\mintinline{c}{\0}.  Because they are arrays, the same precautions must 
be made when working with strings as with general arrays.  The standard 
string library (\mintinline{text}{string.h}) provides many convenience 
functions to manipulate and use strings.

This lab will familiarize you with some of these functions.  In particular, 
you will complete a program that implements a common children's game, 
horse (also known as hangman).  In this game, an English word is chosen 
at random and its characters hidden.  The player takes turns by guessing 
a letter; each instance (if any) of the guessed letter is revealed.  If the 
user is able to guess the word before a certain number of guessed letters 
then they win.  If they run out of guesses then they lose.

Most of the game mechanics have been implemented for you.  However, 
you will need to complete the game by implementing several functions 
used by the game to manipulate and compare strings.

\section{Activities}

Clone the code for this lab from GitHub using the following URL:

\subsection{Implementing String Manipulation Functions}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Navigate to the \mintinline{text}{src} directory and open 
  	\mintinline{text}{gameFunctions.c} in the editor of your choice.
  \item There are several functions already fully implemented in this file.  
	Your task for this lab is to implement the following four functions:
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item \mintinline{c}{initializeBlankString()} - This function should 
	  take two arguments: an integer denoting the length of the 
	  second argument, which should be a character array.  It should 
	  return nothing.   The function should alter the passed array so that 
	  it is filled with underscores, \mintinline{c}{_} and is a properly 
	  terminated string.
	  \item \mintinline{c}{printWithSpaces()} - This function will take a 
	  string as input and print the contents of the string with spaces 
	  between each character.  (Hint: use the strlen() function to find 
	  the size of the passed string).   The function should return nothing.
	  \item \mintinline{c}{revealGuessedLetter()} - This function will take 
	  two strings and a character as input.   The function should alter 
	  the second string in the following way: For every position in the 
	  first string that contains the character passed in as the third 
	  argument to the function, change the same position in the second 
	  string to that character.  For example, if the first string is 
	  \mintinline{c}{"dinosaur"} and the second is \mintinline{c}{"________"}
	  and the character passed is \mintinline{c}{a}, then the function 
	  should alter the second string so that it becomes \mintinline{c}{"_____a__"}.
	  You may assume that the strings are of equal length.   The function 
	  should return a 1 if any letters were changed in the second 
	  string and 0 otherwise.
	  \item \mintinline{c}{checkGuess()} - This function should take 
	  two strings as input.  If the two strings are equivalent, return a 
	  1 from the function.  If they're different, return a 0.  There are at 
	  least two ways to do this: you may use the \mintinline{c}{strcmp()} 
	  function from the string library or you can iterate over every character 
	  in the strings.  You may assume that the strings are equal length.
	\end{itemize}

  \item Navigate to the \mintinline{text}{include} directory and open 
	\mintinline{text}{gameFunctions.h} in the editor of your choice
  \item Complete the function prototypes that you implemented in 
	\mintinline{text}{gameFunctions.c} here.  
  \item Compile the program using the \mintinline{text}{make} command and 
	complete the worksheet.  
\end{enumerate}

\section{Advanced Activity (Optional)}

Currently, the game has a strict limitation on the number and length of 
words a user can enter in the dictionary.txt file.  Alter the program so 
that it can accept any number of words and words of any length from 
\mintinline{text}{dictionary.txt} (hint: you'll need to dynamically allocate 
the memory for the array in \mintinline{text}{main.c}, among other 
changes in \mintinline{text}{gameFunctions.h} and \mintinline{text}{gameFunctions.c}).
